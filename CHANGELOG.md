# Change Log

## v0.5.1

- Supported reflection-time specialization constant expression evaluation. (#77)

## v0.5.0

Finally, SPIR-Q v0.5 has come! The new APIs has breaking changes and is NOT compatible with the usage before. Please refer to the documentation for detail.

- Symbol API is completely removed for simplicity;
- `DescriptorType` is now a separated enum from `Type` and adheres to `VkDescriptorType`;
- `AccessType` is now marked only on storage buffers and images;
- Descriptor resources, push constants, interface variables and push constants are now provided with unified `Variable` API;
- Debug names are now part of `Variable`, `StructMember` and `StructType`.


## v0.4.18

- Supported entry-point execution mode reflection. (#72)
- Fixed that atomically accessed resources are not correctly reflected. (#70)

## v0.4.17

- Improved support for specialization constants. (#67)

## v0.4.16

- Re-exported enums in `spirv_headers` for convenience.
- Fixed potential panic in `AccessType` bit operations.
- Removed dependency on `nohash-hasher`.

## v0.4.15

- Fixed that variables declaration registration, which disallows descriptor resource names to be reflected. (@VirFunc)

## v0.4.14

- Fixed that multiple reference to a single variable in functions was not correctly allowed. (#62)

## v0.4.13

- Fixed typo. (#55)
- Supported acceleration structure for ray-tracing.
- Fast reflection support (reflect without variable dependency analysis).
- Removed unexpectedly exposed `Specialization` APIs.
- Full coverage of GLSL data types.
- Integrate `AccessType` as a part of `Descriptor`, for storage images and buffers.
- Refactorized to a unified variable reference structure.

## v0.4.12

- Relaxed validation of non-interface composite types. (#51)

## v0.4.11

- Redefined `AccessType` as the validity of read or write accesses instead of actual loads/stores by functions. (#49)

## v0.4.10

- Supported customized reflection inspection and opened reflection intermediates. (#47)
- Fixed potential buffer overread when string operand is missing.

## v0.4.9

- Fixed that symbol resolution succeeds when the interface variable kind mismatches. (#46)

## v0.4.8

- Supported structure type name extraction (#44)

## v0.4.7

- Fixed early-terminating decoration parsing (#38);
- Fixed specialization constant composite (#41).

## v0.4.6

- Added API for better user experience.

## v0.4.5

- Supported dynamically sized multi-binding (`SPV_EXT_descriptor_indexing`);
- Fixed tests.

## v0.4.4

- Fixed that separable sampler and image object cannot share a same binding point;
- Fixed field name typo.

## v0.4.3

- Fixed name collision caused by multiple unnamed buffer blocks;
- Fixed interface variable resolution;
- Supported buffer block root type resolution in iteration by `descs`;
- Supported name access to push constant;
- Improved entrypoint debug printing;
- Improved API provision;
- Added comprehensive API testing.

## v0.4.2

- Added a more handy manifest merging method for pipeline construction;
- Supported specialization constant reflection;
- Fixed interface variable resolution.

## v0.4.1

- Fixed that interface variables are not correctly merged;
- Significant performance improvement.

## v0.4.0

- No longer treating push constant as special cases of descriptors;
- Support multibinding for all descriptors;
- Minor clean-up.


## v0.3.0

- Fixed that built-in variables are not correctly ignored;
- Supported component number for shared-location interface variables;
- Added support for separable sampler types;
- Added descriptor access type query;
- Minor safety improvement.


## v0.2.1

- Fixed a typo (`InputAtatchment`);
- Added walking through descriptor types;
- Added an example for descriptor walk.

## v0.2.0

This is a breaking change. SPIR-Q is now more handy with better and easier reflection information accessors.

- Fix several bugs;
- Restructured project files;
- Improved API design.


## v0.1.0

This is a breaking change. Some type names has been changed to be more exact. E.g. previous `NumericType` is now `ScalarType`; and the usage of if has also changed.

- Support boolean types;
- Fix that outer-most types (the types exposed directly to a binding point) cannot be resolved by symbol;
- Added an example reflecting a fragment shader extracted from section 1.10 of the SPIR-V specification;
- Minor performance improvement.

## v0.0.3

- Add dependency to `spirv_headers` for sharable SPIR-V constants and types;
- Add Badges.
